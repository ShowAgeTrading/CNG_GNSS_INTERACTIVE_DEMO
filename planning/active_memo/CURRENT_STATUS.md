## Current Sprint Status

### Sprint Goal
Complete Phase 02 core architecture implementation - event bus, simulation clock, and application framework

### Sprint Backlog (Ready for Implementation)
1. **Implement EventBus Class** (Priority: Critical)
   - Thread-safe publish/subscribe pattern
   - Event filtering and priority queues
   - Performance targets: <1ms per event

2. **Implement SimulationClock** (Priority: Critical)
   - Variable speed time control (0.1x to 100x)
   - Forward and reverse time simulation
   - Component time synchronization

3. **Implement ApplicationFramework** (Priority: High)
   - Component lifecycle management
   - Graceful startup/shutdown sequences
   - Configuration and logging integration

4. **Setup Hot-Reload Infrastructure** (Priority: Medium)
   - Module reloading with state preservation
   - File system watching and change detection
   - Error recovery and rollback mechanisms

5. **Implement Core Testing** (Priority: High)
   - Unit tests for all core components
   - Integration tests for component interaction
   - Performance benchmarking

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All Phase 02 core architecture components implemented
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass for component interaction
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<1ms events, 60 FPS clock)
- [ ] Hot-reload functional with state preservation
- [ ] Phase 03 ready to begin immediately

## Technical Debt and Issues

### Current Technical Debt
- **Skeleton Implementation:** All core files have skeleton classes that need full implementation
- **Missing Tests:** Unit and integration tests need to be created for new implementations
- **Configuration System:** Placeholder config management needs production-ready implementation

### Known Issues
- **Virtual Environment Visibility:** venv/ directory appears as untracked in git status (expected and proper)
- **Skeleton Classes:** All core classes need implementation before functional testing can begin

### Risks Being Monitored
1. **Event Bus Performance** (Medium Risk)
   - Complex event routing may introduce bottlenecks
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks and optimization during implementation

2. **Hot-Reload Complexity** (Medium Risk)
   - State preservation across module reloads is complex
   - Mitigation: Incremental implementation with extensive testing

3. **Component Integration** (Low Risk)
   - Multiple core components must work together seamlessly
   - Mitigation: Clear interfaces and comprehensive integration tests

- **Cross-References:** 100% (All references validated)
- **File Size Compliance:** 100% (All files under 1000-line limits)
- **Enforcement Active:** Dual-layer monitoring (Real-time + Git hooks)
- **Completeness:** 100% (All required sections present)

### Planning Quality
- **Phase Dependencies:** ✅ Clearly mapped
