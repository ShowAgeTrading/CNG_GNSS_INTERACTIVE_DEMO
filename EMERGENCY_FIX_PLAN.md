# GRAPHICS SYSTEM INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION PLAN
**Created:** 2025-09-17  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot  
**Purpose:** Systematic investigation and fix of Phase 3 graphics integration issues  
**Status:** BASE CAMP ESTABLISHED - READY FOR DIAGNOSTIC PHASE  

---

## MISSION STATEMENT
**Objective:** Restore Phase 3 graphics modules to working state while preserving planned modular architecture for Phases 4-10  
**Constraint:** Maintain all Phase 1-2 functionality and architectural decisions  
**Success:** Production graphics modules work identically to proven visual test approach  

## BASE CAMP STATUS: ✅ ESTABLISHED

### Investigation Framework Structure Created

```

## INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL
1. **PHASE A: Diagnostic Collection** - Generate complete system state analysis
2. **PHASE B: Root Cause Analysis** - Identify exact failure mechanisms
3. **PHASE C: Fix Plan Generation** - Create targeted remediation strategies  
4. **PHASE D: Sequential Implementation** - Execute fixes with step validation
5. **PHASE E: Integration Verification** - Comprehensive system testing

## READY FOR PHASE A: DIAGNOSTIC COLLECTION
**Next Actions:**
1. Create master investigation log
2. Build diagnostic tools
3. Generate comprehensive reports
4. Analyze findings before any remediation

**Status:** Investigation base camp operational, ready to proceed with systematic diagnosis
