## Project Overview

### Core Vision
Interactive 3D GNSS/RTK demonstration app providing real-time visualization of satellite constellations, receiver positioning, and error modeling for educational and experimental purposes.

### Architecture Principles (✅ Validated in Phase 02)
- **Strict Modularity:** ✅ Every component hot-reloadable and independently testable
- **Zero Coupling:** ✅ Event-driven architecture with clear interfaces implemented
- **Template Compliance:** ✅ All files follow UNIVERSAL_CODE_TEMPLATE.md
- **File Size Limits:** ✅ 200 lines max per code file, maintained across all implementations
- **Dual-Layer Enforcement:** ✅ Real-time monitoring + Git hooks prevent violations
- **Reference Everything:** ✅ Full cross-referencing maintained

## Phase Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
Phase 01 (Setup) 
    ↓
Phase 02 (Core) → Phase 03 (Graphics) 
    ↓                ↓
Phase 04 (Satellites) → Phase 05 (Receivers)
    ↓                    ↓
Phase 06 (UI) ← ← ← ← ← ←
    ↓
Phase 07 (Data) → Phase 08 (Plugins)
    ↓                ↓
Phase 09 (Testing) → Phase 10 (Deploy)
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Phases 02 & 03 can run partially in parallel (core vs graphics)
- Phases 04 & 05 can develop simultaneously (satellites vs receivers)
- Phase 08 (plugins) can begin once Phase 02 (event bus) is stable

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Event Bus Coupling** - Risk of tight coupling despite event architecture
   - Mitigation: Strict interface contracts, automated coupling detection
2. **Graphics Performance** - Complex 3D scenes may impact responsiveness
   - Mitigation: LOD system, culling, performance budgets per frame
3. **Plugin System Complexity** - Hot-reload may introduce instability
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive state management, graceful fallbacks

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **NMEA Data Parsing** - Real-world data may have edge cases
   - Mitigation: Extensive test data sets, robust error handling
2. **Multi-threading** - Graphics vs simulation vs UI threads
   - Mitigation: Clear thread boundaries, minimal shared state
3. **Memory Management** - Large datasets and 3D models
   - Mitigation: Streaming, caching strategies, memory profiling
