## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Critical Risks (High Impact, High Probability)
1. **Event Bus Bottleneck**

   - **Monitoring:** Event queue depth, processing latency

2. **Hot-Reload State Loss**
   - **Impact:** Development productivity severely reduced
   - **Probability:** Medium (complex state management)

   - **Monitoring:** Time drift measurements

2. **Component Coupling Creep**
   - **Impact:** Modularity compromised, hot-reload broken
   - **Probability:** Medium (natural tendency toward coupling)

   - **Monitoring:** Dependency analysis metrics

### Acceptable Risks (Medium Impact, Low Probability)
1. **Configuration Schema Evolution**
   - **Impact:** Backward compatibility issues
