This is pieced together exclusively from the USGS DEM database. It contains landmass elevations only, with the ocean at zero, and the top of Mt. Everest at 255. Use this as a bump map to give the appearance of the Earth's rugged surface features. Some madmen have also used this data in POV Ray as a displacement map on a very finely divided sphere to produce a "true" 3D version of the Earth. The 10K version is VERY large, so make sure you really need that much detail.
