# INVESTIGATION MASTER LOG - Graphics System Remediation
**Created:** 2025-09-17  
**Purpose:** Central coordination and timeline for graphics system investigation  
**Status:** Phase A - Diagnostic Collection

---

## INVESTIGATION SCOPE

### Core Problem Statement
Production graphics modules (`src/graphics/`) cannot be imported due to broken dependencies, while visual test works by bypassing production code entirely.

### Investigation Constraints
1. **Preserve Phase 1-2 Architecture** - Event bus, simulation clock, app framework must remain intact
2. **Maintain Modular Design** - Graphics components must stay modular for Phases 4-10 requirements
3. **Keep Visual Test Functionality** - Current working 3D Earth visualization must continue working
4. **Ensure Future Compatibility** - Fix must support satellite rendering, UI integration, data systems

## PHASE A: DIAGNOSTIC COLLECTION

### A1: System Dependency Analysis
- **Tool:** `diagnostics/import_chain_analyzer.py` ✅ Created
- **Output:** `reports/dependency_analysis.json`
- **Purpose:** Map complete import chains for all graphics modules
- **Status:** Ready for execution

### A2: Module Health Assessment  
- **Tool:** `diagnostics/module_health_checker.py` ✅ Created
- **Output:** `reports/module_status_report.md`
- **Purpose:** Test import and instantiation of each graphics component
- **Status:** Ready for execution

### A3: Architecture Compliance Check
- **Tool:** `diagnostics/architecture_validator.py` ✅ Created
- **Output:** `reports/architecture_compliance.md`
- **Purpose:** Verify Phase 1-2 integration points remain functional
- **Status:** Ready for execution

### A4: Test Behavior Analysis
- **Tool:** `diagnostics/test_path_tracer.py` ✅ Created
- **Output:** `reports/test_behavior_analysis.md`  
- **Purpose:** Compare visual test success path vs production failure path
- **Status:** Ready for execution
