## Fix Implementation Plan

### Branch Strategy
**Primary Branch:** `fix-graphics-system-YYYYMMDD`
**Backup Branch:** `investigation-backup-YYYYMMDD`

### Checkpoint Commits (Sequential)
1. **Checkpoint A:** Fix core imports
   - Files: [List specific files to modify]
   - Changes: [Specific import/dependency fixes]
   - Test: `python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/import_chain_analyzer.py`
   
2. **Checkpoint B:** Resolve integration issues  
   - Files: [List integration files]
   - Changes: [Integration fixes]
   - Test: `python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/architecture_validator.py`
   
3. **Checkpoint C:** Validate component health
   - Files: [Final files to adjust]
   - Changes: [Component instantiation fixes]
   - Test: `python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/module_health_checker.py`

4. **Checkpoint D:** Full system validation
   - Files: [Any remaining adjustments]
   - Changes: [Final integration tweaks]
   - Test: `python investigation_base_camp/validation/integration_test_suite.py`

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Changes
- [Changes that could break Phase 1-2 functionality]
- **Mitigation:** [Specific backup/rollback steps for each]

### Medium-Risk Changes  
- [Changes that might affect performance]
- **Mitigation:** [Performance validation steps]

### Low-Risk Changes
- [Safe changes with minimal impact]
- **Validation:** [Quick verification steps]

---

## Testing Strategy

### Immediate Validation (After Each Checkpoint)
```powershell
# Import validation
python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/import_chain_analyzer.py

# Architecture integrity
python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/architecture_validator.py

# Component health  
python investigation_base_camp/diagnostics/module_health_checker.py
```

### Full Validation (After All Checkpoints)
```powershell
# Complete integration test
python investigation_base_camp/validation/integration_test_suite.py

# Visual regression test
python investigation_base_camp/validation/visual_regression_test.py

# Performance benchmark
python investigation_base_camp/validation/performance_benchmark.py
```

### Final Acceptance Test
```powershell
# Original test suite
python -m pytest

# Visual functionality test
python tests/visual/test_phase3_visual.py
```

## Rollback Plan

### Emergency Rollback (If Critical Failure)
1. **Immediate:** `git checkout main`
2. **Verify:** Run Phase 1-2 tests to confirm functionality
3. **Document:** Record failure mode in INVESTIGATION_MASTER_LOG.md

### Checkpoint Rollback (If Specific Checkpoint Fails)
1. **Reset to Previous:** `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
2. **Analyze:** Re-run diagnostics to understand failure
3. **Adjust:** Modify fix approach based on new information

### Partial Rollback (If Some Changes Work)
1. **Selective Revert:** `git revert <specific-commit>`
2. **Test:** Validate remaining changes still function
3. **Continue:** Proceed with modified approach
